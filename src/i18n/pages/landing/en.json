Brown rice is slightly better due to its fiber content. However, the only way to know for sure is to test your own body. Individual responses vary greatly. We strongly recommend using the AI tool on aidiabetes.net to see the data yourself. Use it to snap a photo of your next meal with rice and your glucose reading.
